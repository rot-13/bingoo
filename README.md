Bing -> Google


This is a Google Chrome extension to automatically open Bing Map links in Google Maps.

Annoyed that some websites (e.g. Facebook) will insist of opening addresses in Bing maps? 

Be annoyed no more! This extension will automatically convert any new tab opened in Bing maps to Google Maps!

As this is a very initial version, only manual install is supported. Chrome Web Store support will be added later.

**Enjoy!**
